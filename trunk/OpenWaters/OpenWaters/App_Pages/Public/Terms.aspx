        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
        We respect your right to privacy and share your concern about the security of any data you may submit to Open Environment via the Open Waters website. Your privacy is critically important to us. 
        <br /><br />
        We have a few fundamental principles:
        <ul>
            <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights.</li>
            <li>We treat your personal information with the highest regard to privacy and security.</li>
        </ul>
        We only collect personal information about you if you voluntarily choose to share it with us. We do not share, rent or sell information concerning Open Waters members or other users of its website to third parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.
        To use the core functionality of the Site, you must first complete the registration form at the Site and agree to our Terms and Conditions. During registration you will be required to provide personal information such as your name, contact information, and email address. 
        If you choose to share any personal information with Open Environment, Open Environment may store it and use it for internal research and Open Envionment marketing purposes, including e-mailing you with special promotions and other programs of interest. 
        Open Environment does not share, rent or sell your information to another company in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.
        <br /><br />
        When you visit the Site, a cookie will be stored on your computer. Generally, cookies work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of Open Waters. Open Waters' cookies do not contain any personally identifying information; Open Waters uses them to save your access rights - after you’ve entered your member ID and password during a session on the Open Waters website, Open Waters saves that information so you don’t have to re-enter it repeatedly during that session. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the Site unavailable to you. 
        Open Environment may use your IP address to identify you, to administer the Site and to assist in diagnosing server problems.        
        Like most standard Web site servers the Site uses log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 
        You may decide to send Open Environment personally identifying information in an e-mail message which might contain information or inquiries about Open Environment's products or services. Open Environment will use this information to identify you and to respond to the electronic mail. Open Environment will only use the information obtained to resolve the issue identified in the e-mail. 
        <br /><br />
        Open Environment will only share your personal information with third parties if:
        <ul>
            <li>Open Environment has your consent</li>
            <li>Open Environment determines that it is required to do so by law; such as in response to a court order or subpoena</li>
            <li>Open Environment finds that you are in breach of its terms and conditions or any of its policies or usage guidelines for specific products or services</li>
            <li>It is necessary in Open Environment’s opinion to do so to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offenses or attacks on the technical integrity of the Site</li>
            <li>It is necessary in Open Environment’s opinion to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of Open Environment or its employees, the users of its website(s), or the public</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Termination</h3>
